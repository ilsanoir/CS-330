# CS-330
While I didn't implement it, this project made me more aware of the importance of modularity. Not only does it save time, it makes your work significantly more presentable. 

The most important design principle that I did follow was regular testing. Whenever I made changes that would cause meaningful (or even trivial) alterations to my render, I would run it just to ensure everything was working as intended.

The way the class was structured prioritized iteration. Every week, we added a significant chunk to the code as we developed toward the final project submission. These additions were also independent from anything we wanted to add from week to week. 
So it encouraged working at our own pace, while providing a general outline for where we should be each week. 

I particulalry appreciated this as it speaks to my style of code development, writing in batches. The main goal of this style is ensure that the code is left in a functional state between each additon/iteration on the code.

This class served as a very solid foundation into the world of computer graphics. From here I can continue to develop my skills and eventually continue on to apply those skills to things like 3-D animation, or game development.
